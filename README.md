# 675.701_AP2
Advanced Flight Software Practicum 

## Usage

I designed this so the assignment files can be cloned into its own directory in /home/fsw. All the changes will be made here and the helper shell files will copy and updates to the proper tables location, build the fsw, and start the fsw. 

## Aliases

I made aliases for building the FSW (```bfsw```), starting the FSW (```sfsw```), and starting Cosmos (```cos```). You can run add_aliases.sh to put them in your ~/.bash_aliases file.
